# 👀 Why Loadless?

<font align="left" size="3">
  <ul>
    <li>Create pages that do not load or refresh the page without writing any javascript code.</li>
    <li>Build modals and popups that would normally require you to manipulate the DOM without writing a single javascript line</li>
    <li>Implement page loading transitions and animations without writing any CSS</li>
    <li>Customize loadless to what you find suitable (no javascript knowledge required)</li>
    <li>Easy setup: you just need to link 2 CDN</li>
  </ul>
</font>

### 🛠 Setup
Add this script tag in your HTML's header (make sure to `defer` it)
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/loadless/loadless@main/dist/loadless.min.js" defer></script>
```

If you want to make the best out of loadless link this CSS cdn, it's optional though and the library would work even without it
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/loadless/loadless@main/dist/animations.css">
```
